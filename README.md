## Castle Clash
- AR lego building game for iOS
- horizontal plane detection generates surface on which castle blocks can be placed
- blocks that aren't placed on the surface will fall thru (and disappear)
- game physics set to normal gravitational acceleration(1g)
- ML models for hand gesture detection
- user can 'grip' castle blocks in scene and stack blocks on top/next to one another
- when debug mode on, the block that is gripped will be highlighted in red
- blender castle block assets

### Comments
